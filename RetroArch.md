## RetroArch is not an emulator itself, but rather an application that serves as a base to install different emulators on it and run the ROMs with them.

### Bios

In the settings we enter Directories (Settings -> Directories), in the System/Bios section we will see a default folder called bios, in which we will put all the necessary bios so that the emulator can start and work correctly.

### Cores

Besides, in the same place we will find in the Cores section where there is a default folder called cores, in which we will put all the files to start the console that we are emulating.

### Scaling

To change the image scaling we enter scaling (settings -> video -> scaling) in the aspect ratio section we select configuration so that the image occupies the entire screen.

### Controls

Within input (settings -> input) we modify the controls of port X, in each port we assign a control, inside we will see the option Device Index where we will assign the control we want, and below to assign the controls to our liking.


### Shaders :

* We have put shaders to be able to visualize the games in a more retro way and the image is not so clear.
* One of the shaders that we have put crt-geom-deluxe.slang:
  * In the first image we can see how the image looks sharper and without black horizontal lines, on the other hand. 
  * In the second image it becomes a retro style because we can see that the sharpness decreases and we appreciate the black stripes.
