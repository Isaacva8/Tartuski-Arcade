**RetroArch is not an emulator itself, but rather an application that serves as a base to install different emulators on it and run the ROMs with them.
Setting:**

* The first thing we have modified are the controls to be able to play and navigate the menu correctly.
* We have changed the scale of the in-game image, so that the black sidebars are not visible in order to have a greater visual space of the game.
* A very important option has been to download and install the necessary kernels for each emulator, since without them it is not possible for a game to start.

**Shaders :**

* We have put shaders to be able to visualize the games in a more retro way and the image is not so clear.
* One of the shaders that we have put crt-geom-deluxe.slang:
  * In the first image we can see how the image looks sharper and without black horizontal lines, on the other hand. 
  * In the second image it becomes a retro style because we can see that the sharpness decreases and we appreciate the black stripes.
